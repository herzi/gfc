README for GFC
==============

GFC is a collection of classes that I regularly re-use in my projects; thus,
it's usually used as a git-submodule for other projects. It contains:

 * GfcJob: a helpful class for executing commands and probably parsing their
   output
 * GfcProperty*: helpers for automatically generated user interfaces for con-
   figurating objects
 * GfcReader: a class built on top of GIOChannel which permits simple line-
   based parsing
 * GfcSpawn*: helper classes for the GfcJob to be able to use different spawn
   functions
